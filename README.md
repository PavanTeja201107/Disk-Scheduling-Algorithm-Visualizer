# Disk Scheduling Algorithms Visualizer 

A web-based simulator that visualizes disk scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK using HTML5 Canvas and Plotly. Includes animated head movement, voice narration, and PDF export functionality.

**Disk Head Animation**: Simulates head movement for different algorithms.
- **Algorithm Support**: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK.
- **Voice Narration**: Speaks out algorithm steps in real-time.
- **Performance Charts**: Plots seek time and total head movement.
- **PDF Export**: Export results and comparisons using jsPDF.
